        <p className="quote">Wow! This tour made me realize how much I love being outside with my friends. After going on one of these tours, I can safely say that beer pong is my favorite game all time, also the cultural programs were really interesting!</p>

        <p className="quote">Wow, this really blew my mind. We had so much fun at the beach, and also some hidden secrets revealed. Come on, I'm living in this city for 5 years. Amazing!</p>
        <p className="author">- Sharon Rosenberg</p>
        <p className="quote">If you want to understand your friends better, head to the mountains. I mean, seriously. It's like sitting next to a campfire and just talk in the sunset, woah. You know? It's like that.</p>
